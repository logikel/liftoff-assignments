### Overview

Table-top roleplaying games (TTRPGs) are dice-based games played in a group, led by one individual known as the Game Master (GM) who interacts with the player characters (PCs)
as a series of non-player characters (NPCs) in order to guide the players through an interactive story. The most popular TTRPG that pretty much everyone has at least heard 
of before is Dungeons and Dragons, but there are a number of different systems that contain different settings, rules, mechanics, dice-rolling structures, histories, species,
and experiences for every flavor of player. They are, in my opinion, the ultimate form of creative interactive storytelling, and if I could spend all my spare time playing
and running games, I probably would. However, there are only so many hours in the day, and the human body requires maintenance, so I settle for keeping a few games with 
different groups running a few nights a week, whenever possible. One of the ways I satiate this desire is by thinking about pre-existing characters in current or previous
campaigns (which is what the storylines for different games are commonly called) or coming up with ideas for new ones. And while many games have started catching up with
advancing technologies and allow for digital character creation, most character generation is done on paper. I keep my character sheets incredibly organized because I know 
I will lose them otherwise, but some of my friends that I play with suffer constantly with lost, misplaced, or damaged papers that hinder the flow of gameplay. I want as few
distractions from my games as possible, so I intend to create a visually interesting and easy-to-use website for my friends and maybe others to store and view their 
characters from different games. It'll also be helpful for GMs so they too are able to quickly view the stats of their players, and maybe store important NPC information 
as well, if I'm feeling ambitious.
